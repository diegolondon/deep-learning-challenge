-Overview of the analysis: 

The deep learning model achieved the desired performance of 79.27% accuracy in predicting the success of funded charities. 
From this set we removed the data/columns that were non-beneficial, 'EIN and 'NAME'. 
The target variables used were the 'application' value count and the 'classification' count.

At 79.27%, the model did exceed the target performance of 75% accuracy requested in this challenge. However, multiple attempts were made to optimize the model,
including adjusting input data, modifying the structure of the neural network, and modifying the training regimen.
